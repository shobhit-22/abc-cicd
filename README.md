# ABC Web App
I have created web application with the help of Node.js and Express.js to implement CI/CD with GitLab.

I implemented Node.js application locally, integrating unit testing. 

Key Steps Taken: 

Development: Created a Dockerfile and gitlab-ci.yml to manage build, test, and deploy stages. 

Setup: Installed Docker Desktop and GitLab Runner on my system (Windows). Registered GitLab Runner with necessary configurations like URL, token, executors, and used same tags in gitlab-ci.yml. 

Configuration: Configured the gitlab-ci.yml file to orchestrate the build, test, and deploy stages seamlessly. 

Execution: Committed the code and initiated the pipeline on GitLab.
